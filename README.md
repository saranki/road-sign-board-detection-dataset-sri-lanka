# Road Signboard Detection

## Summary
This repository is to provide researchers in the traffic domain with a good dataset of road signboards.
All the images were manually collected by the author from roads majorly in Sri Lanka. Majority of the signboards are generally applicable for Asian countries as well as some European.

This was initially collected as part my research [Smart Driving Assistance System to Elevate the Driving Experience in Sri Lanka - Dryv Assist](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8550065). There are a very few datasets in this domain and none of them yielded a good result for the Neural Networks I used for the research, thus myself and [Munsif](https://github.com/munsif3) took it upon ourselves to produce a usable dataset.

## Files
The dataset can be found in this [Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vEcsM_1wKM3wvrvYimGCQcemD-I1SBMP).
All images are of .jpg format and the corresponding annotations and bounding boxes are found in the .xml files attached to the images.
* Train
* Test

## Expectations
* Signboard detection in real-time
* Traffic control system
* A centralized traffic sign information hub
* Statistical data for an area
* Encourage similar research in this domain
